# Techie Tinkers

Welcome to the Techie Tinkers project. Whether you are a techie or just a tinker, I hope you'll find something useful here about programming.

Many of the items you'll see in this project can be simply read; however, to take full advantage, you'll want to clone and play with examples provided.

1) [Learn Git](Learn\%20Git)

2) [Learn Docker](Learn\%20Docker)

3) [Learn Laravel](Learn\%20Laravel)


## Additional Resources

- **HTML/CSS:** We won't go into much details here about HTML or CSS, but a good beginners reference for HTML and CSS can be found here: [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp). We don't recommend using W3Schools for other programming languages as some of their examples are outdated or prone to security vulnerabilities, but they do a good job of HTML/CSS intro.
- **Semantic Versioning:** It's a great idea to learn how semantic versioning works. Check that out here: https://semver.org
