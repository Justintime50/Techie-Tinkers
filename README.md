## Additional Resources

- **HTML/CSS:** We won't go into much detail here about HTML or CSS, but a good beginners reference for HTML and CSS can be found here: [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp). W3 Schools is a decent beginners reference, but is not recommended for advanced examples as some of their lessons are outdated or prone to security vulnerabilities.
- **Semantic Versioning:** It's a great idea to learn how semantic versioning works. Check that out here: https://semver.org
