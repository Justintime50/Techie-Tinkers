# Intro to Git

Hey there, let's learn about Git! Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.

## Repositories

You may have heard of popular repository hosting services such as Github, Gitlab or Amazon's CodeCommit. These are all servicces that house your code in a repository, version controlled, and readily accessible to those with access. Doing so through the powerful program of Git allows users to push and pull data quickly and collaboratively.

## Git Clone

Let's start with something simple. After installing git, let's clone this project's repository. Navigate to the directory you want to install this project via a terminal and use the command `git clone ...` and replace the dots with the URL pulled from Github. If all went well, you should have a new folder titled after this project with all the files inside of it. Congratulations, you've made your first Git command!

## Git Pull

Using the command `git pull` will pull down all the changes on the current branch to your local machine.

## Git Push

Using the command `git push` will push up all the changes on the current local branch to that respective branch on the repository.

There you have it! You now know the basics of Git. Let's move on.
