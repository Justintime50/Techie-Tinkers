# Intro to Git

Let's learn about Git! Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.

## Installation

First, let's [install Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03). If you've installed Git, we can move on and clone this GitHub project.

## Repositories

You may have heard of popular repository hosting services such as GitHub, GitLab or Amazon's CodeCommit. These are all services that house your code in a repository - version controlled, and readily accessible to those with access. Doing so through the powerful program of Git allows users to push and pull data quickly and collaboratively.

## Git Clone

Let's start with something simple. After installing git, let's clone this project's repository. Navigate to the directory you want to install this project in via a terminal and use the command `git clone REPO_URL` and swap in the URL from GitHub. If all went well, you should have a new folder titled after this project with all the files inside of it. Congratulations, you've used your first Git command!

## Git Pull

Using the command `git pull` will pull down all the changes on the current branch to your local machine.

## Git Push

Using the command `git push` will push up all the changes on the current local branch to that respective branch on the repository.

## Conclusion

There you have it! You now know the basics of Git.
